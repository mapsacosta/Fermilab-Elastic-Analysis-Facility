Welcome to the Fermilab EAF documentation!
===================================

The **Fermilab Elastic Analysis Facility** is a set of infrastructure and services that provide integrated data, software and computational resources to execute one or more elements of analysis workflows for Fermilab experiments and scientists. These resources are centrally managed by the Scientific Computing Division at Fermilab as part of the EAF project. Check out the :doc:`getting started` section for further information, including how to :ref:`log in`, navigate the environments and use the analysis tools ecosystem.
